# WhatsLiberation

**Status:** Experimental / Proof of Concept

**Description:**

`WhatsLiberation` is an ambitious open-source project designed to automate the bulk export of WhatsApp conversations—including text messages and media (photos, videos, audio, documents)—from an Android device to a local filesystem. Leveraging the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for UI automation, this Kotlin-based tool interacts with WhatsApp’s native "Export chat" functionality to extract and organize chat data into a structured, user-friendly format. The project explores innovative solutions to a complex problem, balancing technical creativity with practical utility.

## Highlights
- Automates WhatsApp chat exports using ADB-driven UI interactions.
- Supports both text-only and media-inclusive exports (in development).
- Organizes data into a logical folder structure for easy access.
- Built with Kotlin for robust scripting and extensibility.
- Open-source, inviting collaboration and real-world testing.

## Motivation

People deserve **data sovereignty**—the right to control, access, and preserve their own digital information. WhatsApp, while a powerful communication tool, locks user data within its ecosystem, offering limited native options for bulk export or long-term archival. `WhatsLiberation` empowers users to reclaim ownership of their conversations and media, providing a pathway to liberate personal data from proprietary constraints. This project is a step toward a future where individuals, not platforms, dictate the fate of their digital footprint.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WhatsLiberation`
2. Install prerequisites: Kotlin, JDK, Android SDK.
3. Connect an Android device via USB with USB debugging enabled.
4. Build the project:  
   `./gradlew build`
5. Run with options:  
   `./gradlew run --args="--help"`

## Prerequisites
- Kotlin 1.6+
- JDK 11+
- Android device (10.0+) with WhatsApp installed
- ADB installed and configured
- USB debugging enabled
- WhatsApp chats targeted for export

## Compatibility
- Tested on Android 10.0+ (earlier versions untested).
- WhatsApp v2.23.X.X (as of February 2025)—subject to change with updates.
- Fragility expected due to reliance on WhatsApp’s UI.

## Why This Matters
No widely-adopted, actively-maintained open-source tools currently exist for bulk WhatsApp exports via ADB automation. `WhatsLiberation` aims to fill this gap, offering a proof-of-concept that could evolve into a reliable solution with community input. The project tackles significant technical challenges—UI automation fragility, media handling complexity, and cross-version compatibility—making it a compelling exploration for developers and innovators.

**Disclaimer:**  
This is an experimental tool. ADB-based automation is inherently fragile and may break with WhatsApp updates. Use it as a foundation for experimentation, not a production-ready backup solution, and test thoroughly before relying on it.

## Project Milestones
- [x] Initial ADB connectivity and setup.
- [x] Documentation for environment configuration.
- [ ] Single chat export automation.
- [ ] Bulk chat list iteration.
- [ ] Full text export with filesystem organization.
- [ ] Media export and extraction (in progress).

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 Weeks)
- Establish ADB integration and Kotlin scripting environment.
- Analyze WhatsApp’s UI with `uiautomatorviewer` to map export workflows.
- Build a script for exporting a single text-only chat.

### Phase 2: Core Automation (2-4 Weeks)
- Implement chat list iteration and bulk export logic.
- Save text exports to a structured filesystem (e.g., `exports/chat_name.txt`).
- Add configurability (e.g., chat selection, timeouts).

### Phase 3: Media Integration (3-5 Weeks)
- Extend automation to handle "With media" exports.
- Develop methods to extract and organize media files (e.g., ZIP handling, `adb pull`).
- Link media to corresponding chats with timestamps or metadata.

### Phase 4: Polish & Scale (Ongoing)
- Enhance error handling and logging for robustness.
- Optimize performance with Kotlin coroutines or parallel processing.
- Test across devices, Android versions, and WhatsApp updates.
- Publish comprehensive docs and a user guide.

## Technical Stack
- **Kotlin:** Core scripting and logic.
- **ADB:** Device interaction and UI automation.
- **Android SDK:** UI inspection via `uiautomatorviewer`.
- **Development Tools:** IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio.
- **Test Hardware:** Android device with WhatsApp.

## Challenges
- **UI Volatility:** WhatsApp updates may alter UI elements, requiring frequent script adjustments.
- **Media Complexity:** Automating media extraction via ADB is non-trivial and device-dependent.
- **Reliability:** ADB automation lacks native robustness, demanding creative workarounds.

## Aspirational Features
- **Dynamic UI Detection:** Use image recognition or ML to adapt to UI changes.
- **Fallback Mechanisms:** Handle failures gracefully with manual overrides or retry logic.
- **CLI/GUI Options:** Offer a simple interface for non-technical users.

## Security Notes
- Operates locally—no data is sent to external servers.
- Exports are unencrypted; secure your filesystem accordingly.
- Review privacy implications before sharing exported data.

## Contributing
This is an open-source initiative—your expertise can accelerate progress! Potential contributions:
- Refine UI automation logic.
- Solve media export challenges.
- Test on diverse devices and WhatsApp versions.
- Enhance documentation or add examples.

Submit pull requests or open issues on GitHub to get involved.

## Troubleshooting
- **ADB Connection Issues:** Verify USB debugging and device visibility (`adb devices`).
- **UI Automation Fails:** Recheck coordinates or element IDs after WhatsApp updates.
- **Timeouts:** Adjust script parameters for larger chats.
